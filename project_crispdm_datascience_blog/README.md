## Projects
Project 1: Analysing Seattle AirBnB data

### 1. Installations
This project was coded in Python 3, and was built within the Kaggle interface and environment. 
The following Python packages were used:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - datetime
 - calendar
 - matplotlib
 - time
 - sklearn.preprocessing
 - sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split)
 - sklearn.preprocessing
 - sklearn.metrics (accuracy_score, mean_squared_error, median_absolute_error, r2_score)
 - sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression, RidgeCV, Lasso)
 - sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeRegressor)
 - sklearn.compose (TransformedTargetRegressor)

### 2. Project Motivation
In this analysis, we analysed Seattle Airbnb data. In order to set the scene, let's assume that we are looking to buy an investment property in Seattle. We are intending to rent out the property through Airbnb and maximise our revenue returns from rental income. Guided by that, we are interested in learning more about the following: 
> 1. What are the highest revenue generating locations for Seattle hosts?
> 2. When in the year are the highest revenues generated?
> 3. What are the property traits that attract the highest revenues? 

### 3. File Descriptions
This repo contains one file, called 'Seattle_ABNB_analysis-MikeBong.ipynb' that contains the code. The data used the project is contained in the folder 'input' within which there are 3 csv files: 'reviews.csv', 'listings.csv', 'calendar.csv'.

### 4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
The Seattle AirBnB data was obtained from Kaggle. Other references are cited within the notebook.
